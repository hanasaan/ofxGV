## ofxGV
Addon for solving geometric vision problems using the open source library OpenGV
http://laurentkneip.github.io/opengv/

Only very simple conversion functions are implemented.
Working in progress.

## Note
I'm using [pmoulon's boostless branch](https://github.com/pmoulon/opengv/tree/develop_boostless) which exploits C++11 features.

Built on OSX. Tested on OF v0.9.2.
